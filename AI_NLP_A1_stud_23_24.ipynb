        "**Perplexity** is very frequently used **metric** for evaluating probabilistic models such as language models. The perplexity (sometimes called **PP** for short) of a language model on a sentence is the **inverse probability** of the sentence, **normalized** by the number of words:\n",

        "Note: Calculation of perplexity has resemblance with the **geometric mean** $(x_1\\cdots x_n)^{-\\frac{1}{n}}$ of the numbers $x_1,\\dots,x_n$. It is like the (regular) arithmetic mean, but with **products** instead of **sums**. The geometric mean is a more natural choice in the case of *PP* because behind $P(w_1\\dots w_n)$ is a series of $n$ products ([more here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geometric_mean)).\n",

But in the N-gram approach, increasing $n$ will quickly kill all generalizing abilities of the model: the model will start to assign probabilities only to sentences it has seen in the training data.\n",

        "A much more sophisticated method of smoothing is **Kneser-Ney smoothing**. The method is described in detail in section 4.5 of J&M (3rd edition). This is one of the best-performing N-gram smoothing methods, and up to a few years ago, a popular implementation of it called [KenLM](https://kheafield.com/code/kenlm/) gave state-of-the-art results.\n",

What if instead we let our basic units of modelling be **characters**? The task then becomes to model $p(c_k\\mid c_{k-N-1}\\dots c_{k-1})$ where each $c_i$ is now an ASCII character instead of an entire word.\n",
        "\n",
        "Suddenly sparsity of data is no longer a problem! The set of characters to use is tiny (< 100) compared to even a small-sized vocabulary as today. Have a look at this very illustrative notebook written by Yoav Golberg to see such a method in action: [The unreasonable effectiveness of Character-level Language Models](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/gist/yoavg/d76121dfde2618422139).\n",

Go ahead and read it if you haven't already: it is a superb introduction to the topic of Recurrent Neural Networks.\n",
        "\n",
        "Neural language models solve the problem of data sparsity in a different manner. Instead of estimating the probabilities $p(w_k\\mid w_{k-N-1}\\dots w_{k-1})$ by counting occurrences in the data, they use a neural network $f_{\\theta}$ parametrized by parameters $\\theta$ to predict this probability. The parameters $\\theta$ are learned through optimization.\n",
        "\n",
        "The simplest approach goes like this: each word in the history $w_{k-N-1}\\dots w_{k-1}$ is embedded separately giving vectors $e_{k-N-1}\\dots e_{k-1}$ and then concatenated into one long vector $[e_{k-N-1};\\dots ;e_{k-1}]$. The network then uses this history vector to predict a probability distribution over words $w$ in the vocabulary $V$:\n",
        "\n",
        "$$p(w \\mid w_{k-N-1}\\dots w_{k-1}) = f_{\\theta}([e_{k-N-1};\\dots;e_{k-1}]).$$\n",
        "\n",
        "(In order to produce legitimate probabilities the final layer of such a network will be for example a $softmax$.)\n",
        "\n",
        "This provides a solution to the sparsity problem by having the network let the individual embeddings of the words in the history interact through its non-linear transformation. We are letting the network figure out the smoothing itself!\n",
        "\n",
        "RNNs are a clever extension of this idea, where a hidden state vector $h$ is re-used and updated at each step $k$ in order to store the information of the entire history up to step $k-1$. That is, an RNN actually does away with the N-order approximation; it tries to model the full conditional directly! That means that\n",

        "\n",
        "Another great place to learn about RNNs, their problems, and solutions to those, is on the blog of [Christopher Olah](http://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/).\n",
